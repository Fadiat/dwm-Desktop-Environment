cd dwm
sudo make install
```
Users of Arch-based distros can also install it from the AUR as [dwm-luke-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dwm-luke-git).

## Please install `libxft-bgra`!

This build of dwm does not block color emoji in the status/info bar, so you must install [libxft-bgra](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra/) from the AUR, which fixes a libxft color emoji rendering problem, otherwise dwm will crash upon trying to render one. Hopefully this fix will be in all libxft soon enough.
